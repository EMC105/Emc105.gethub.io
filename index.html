  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Everyone knows that Iâ€™m writing this, so abiding by the norm that dictates about me 
      statements be written in the third person feels very deceptive.
      In that same effect I will now do my best to describe myself as honestly as possible. 
      My name is Emma Cichocki, I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh,
      and my future plans involve working with kids, whether that be as an occupational therapist 
      or on an advertising team devoted to creating kid targeted campaigns.
      I feel I excel in areas such as creativity, whimsicality, and innovation
      all of which I intend on channeling directly into making a future of making children smile in one way or another. </p>
